      <p data-i18n="story_message">Do you know the name "Golf Honma"? From long ago, this has been the aspirational name of many golfers, a top-class "Made in Japan" golf club brand, widely supported not only in Japan but worldwide. Our KENTACK brand inherits the proud tradition and superior techniques that Golf Honma has preserved to this day. The current KENTACK Golf Company is built on the foundations of the Honma Golf Company. Honma Golf was originally founded by the Honma brothers, Yukihiro and Hiroo. After leaving the hands of these founders, it became a foreign-invested company. Founder Yukihiro Honma worried the brand identity he had worked so hard to build would be lost, so in 2007 he established KENTACK Golf to protect the Honma spirit and preserve its traditions and craftsmanship. During the golden era of golf clubs, Yukihiro Honma was a genius who created the highest-grade clubs of the time, naming his top-class clubs "HIRO HONMA". Like an artisan, he drew on 50 years of experience and craftsmanship, pursuing the harmony of performance and beauty, and re-launched the genuine Honma brand as KENTACK. After nearly ten years he no longer leads the company, but the traditions and techniques he left remain alive in KENTACK. Our clubs offer easier, more accurate, longer shots, with refined elegance and artistic design, made possible by meticulous Japanese craftsmanship. We promise to continue providing the highest-quality, top-class golf clubs, adding value for discerning customers, demonstrating that KENTACK deserves to preserve these features while never resting on the past and continuously advancing our technology.</p>
